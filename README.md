# THIS DOES NOT PREDICT 100% WHEN ITS GOING TO CRASH:
Instead either it uses a betting strategy or compares the previous crash games to see if it'd be a good idea to bet or to find a good multiplier

# Setup

1 - The multiplier is the point at which the program will auto bet at
2 - The bet amount is the amount of robux to bet each time
3 - Games averaged is the amount of games the program will check (Streakbased only)
4 - Auto stop is the amount of Robux at which the program will stop betting.
5 - Auto restart means the program won't ask you to restart betting with your origanal amount when the new increased bet amount is more than your account's balance (Streakbased only)
6 - Your authorization is the token used on bloxflip to place bets. To get your own auth go onto bloxflip press inspect element and go into the console. Then paste the following code

```
localStorage.getItem('_DO_NOT_SHARE_BLOXFLIP_TOKEN')
```

# Usage âš 
To run the program make sure you have python installed and also pip. If you don't install python here https://www.python.org/downloads/. <br>
Pip should be preinstalled but if it isn't go to  https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/ <br>
Once you have done these two things either run installer.bat or open cmd CD to the directory and type the following command
```
pip install requirements.txt
```
